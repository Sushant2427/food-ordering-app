# Food Ordering App

A user-friendly food ordering app built using React and Bootstrap. The app allows users to browse menus, add items to the cart, and proceed with checkout. The app includes features like login, order history, and live order tracking.

## Features

- **Homepage**: Display featured items and login/signup options.
- **Menu Page**: Display list of available food items with options to add to cart.
- **Cart Page**: View and manage the items in the cart before proceeding to checkout.
- **Checkout Page**: Enter delivery details and place an order.
- **Order Status Page**: Track the status of your order in real-time.
- **Order History Page**: View all past orders placed by the user.
- **Login/Signup**: User authentication for personalized experience.

## Technologies Used

Frontend:
React JS – A powerful JavaScript library used for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

Bootstrap – A popular CSS framework used for creating a clean, responsive, and mobile-friendly layout.

Backend:
(No backend has been implemented yet. The project currently functions as a frontend-only application. A backend using Node.js and Express can be added in the future for features like order management, user authentication, and storing data persistently.)

Database:
(Currently, the app uses in-memory state for cart and order management. In a future version, a database such as Firebase, MongoDB, or MySQL can be integrated to store user data and order history.)

Authentication:
The app includes basic frontend authentication using React state.

Users can sign up and log in, and pages like Cart, Checkout, and Order Status are protected—only accessible after login.

In future versions, this can be extended using a real authentication provider like Firebase Auth or JWT-based authentication from a custom backend.
