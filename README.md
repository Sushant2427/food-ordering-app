# 🍔 Food Ordering App

A user-friendly food ordering app built using **React** and **Bootstrap**. The app allows users to browse menus, add items to the cart, and proceed with checkout. It includes features like **login/signup**, **order history**, and **live order tracking** for a seamless experience.

## 🚀 Features

- **Homepage** – Displays featured items and login/signup options.
- **Menu Page** – Showcases available food items with options to add to the cart.
- **Cart Page** – Lets users view and manage items before placing an order.
- **Checkout Page** – Collects delivery details and processes the order.
- **Order Status Page** – Tracks the real-time status of the order.
- **Order History Page** – Displays all previously placed orders by the user.
- **Login/Signup** – Provides user authentication for a personalized experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React JS** – JavaScript library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Bootstrap** – CSS framework for creating a clean, responsive, and mobile-friendly layout.

### Backend:
*(No backend has been implemented yet. The app currently runs as a frontend-only application. A backend using Node.js and Express can be added in the future for order management and persistent storage.)*

### Database:
*(Currently, the app uses in-memory state for managing the cart and order data. A future update can include integration with Firebase, MongoDB, or MySQL for permanent data storage.)*

### Authentication:
- Uses basic **frontend authentication** with React state.
- Users can **sign up and log in**.
- Sensitive pages like **Cart**, **Checkout**, and **Order Status** are **protected**.
- Future plans include integration with **Firebase Auth** or **JWT-based authentication**.
